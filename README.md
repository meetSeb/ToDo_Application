The goal of this project is to develop a to-do list application that stands out for its aesthetically pleasing design and high user-friendliness. The focus is on a few core functions, which, due to their reduced design, lead to intuitive usability and thus improve the overall user experience.

The project scope is defined by the basic functions of a to-do list (creating, editing, deleting, and displaying tasks) and their implementation in a Kanban style, ensuring a clear and focused user experience. I want to ensure that the application is simple and free from distractions, and I intend to adhere to design principles that balance both functionality and visual appeal. In addition, it is important to meet the requirements of a detailed documentation of the project.

The result of the project should be a powerful desktop application for Windows that enables efficient task management and is both practical and visually appealing. The application should stand out from other to-do list applications through its individual design and intuitive use. The product will be developed according to the given software engineering methods, where I will use Python as one of the approved object-oriented programming languages. The application will have a self-explanatory, graphical user interface and will be compatible with Windows 10/11. The entire source code and project documentation will be available on GitHub to ensure the traceability and transparency of the project.
